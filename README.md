# Titanic Survival Prediction - Classification

Predictions will be made on survival outcomes based on the Titanic dataset.

The target variable, whether a passenger survived or not, is a binary outcome (0 or 1), making it suitable for classification modeling. Therefore, classification algorithms are appropriate for this task.

### Variable Notes
* Pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
  * 1st = Upper
  * 2nd = Middle
  * 3rd = Lower
* Age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
* SibSp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

## Results

* I have submitted the predictions generated by different classifiers to the Titanic Kaggle competition: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic. Here are the scores obtained:

### Model Performance:

1) Score: 0.77511 | GradientBoostingClassifier

2) Score: 0.77033 | BernoulliNB

3) Score: 0.75837 | GaussianNB

4) Score: 0.74162 | RandomForestClassifier
  * Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
  * Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
* Parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
  * Parent = mother, father
  * Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
      * Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
